## Ethical Implications
Building a flight reservation system like AeroQuest requires that we consider ethical responsibilities and the impact of engineering solutions in societal contexts. 
This includes thinking of the data privacy and security, fairness, and transparency with its users.

When users create accounts and log in, they provide personal information that must be protected and securely stored. 
Ensuring that their information is confidential is important to prevent data breaches or identity theft. 
This requires that we have encryption and access control methods that are communicated with the users. 
In the collection of this personal data, users should also be informed about the purpose of collecting their data. 
This gives the user the ability to make a decision about whether to create an account and log in. 

There should be a mitigation of bias in the application especially those used for flight recommendations and pricings. 
It is notoriously known that airline companies often sell the same seat at different prices at different times to maximize profits. 
The economic impact would be to ensure that prices are stable and not monopolized to increase profit. 
In the AeroQuest application, fairness considerations should be integrated into the design to ensure that price is equal for each user. 
There is also the consideration that this app is accessible to people from diverse backgrounds. 
To access the website, the user needs access to WIFI and a supportive browser such as Google Chrome.

In terms of professional responsibilities, we as engineers are responsible for developing an application that is functional with no bugs. 
A global impact of this flight reservation system is to ensure that people across the globe can reserve flights. 
Though the current site is limited to flights in the United States, to allow global connectivity would mean to include international flights as well. 
The environmental impact of this reservation system is to reduce the amount of data stored. 
In addition, providing a paperless ticketing system will lead to a reduction of paper consumption reducing the overall carbon footprint.
